# "dec2hex"
A school project for converting decimal numbers to hex.

##How the program works:

The user is first prompted to choose big or little endian byte ordering.
With that set, the user is prompted for decimal numbers to convert to hex.
This continues until the user enters 0.

##Build:

Download everything and run "make." The Makefile requires GNU make, of
course, as well as GCC.

##Colophon:

This program was written 100% in C with standards in mind. It has been
built and tested on Linux and Mac OS.

##Disclaimer:

This is code from a school project. It satisfies assignment requirements
but is nowhere near as "scrubbed" as released software should be.
Security is not addressed, only functionality and no input validation. The
assignment scope was limited so there are bound to be issues and quirks.

If you use this code for anything other than satisfying your curiosity,
please keep the following in mind:

- there is no warranty of any kind (you use the code as-is)
- there is no support offered, please do not ask
- there is no guarantee it'll work, although it's not complex so it should
  work
- please do not take credit for code you did not write, especially if you
  are a student. NO CHEATING.

Thanks!
